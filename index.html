The Vienna Colored School was the Town of Vienna’s public school for African-American children. Prior to the start of the 1939-40 school year, African-American children living in Vienna attended a schoolhouse located at the intersection of Lawyers Road and Malcolm Road.

            This is where I spend time with my friends playing soccer, kickball, basketball, and having fun. I always go to the kickball field (where we play kickball) and I wait for about 2 minutes for my friends to come. There is also a track were you can exercise and run. Finally, the playground were alot of people play fun games. My school has everything I need!
